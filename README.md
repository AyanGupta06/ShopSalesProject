# ShopSalesProject

This project has been carried out using Google Colab and is based on publicly available datasets to carry out an in-depth analysis. 
The idea was to use Python libraries so that the data would be sorted and processed, and then be visualized through different chart types to derive a conclusion of which segments of customers, departments, regions, and products are the most contributing features toward the business. 
The project utilizes key data analysis and visualization libraries such as Pandas for manipulation and Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful charts.
This project analyzed a wide range of visualization techniques and unearthed patterns and trends that can provide strategic business decisions through bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots. 
This analysis is driven by the need to identify those areas in which the business is strong and provides considerable profitability information where it is most strong across various categories. Similar methods can be utilized to find low performs in order to boost business performance.
This project demonstrates how Python can play a role in business strategy and ensure profitability.
